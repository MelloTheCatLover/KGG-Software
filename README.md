Application for interaction of a large number of players with the mechanics of the game in real life - KGG

Creating a web application to interact with players with the interface of a game I created. 

The game process takes place in real life, but with a large number of players, it is impossible to control and monitor the process of scoring and other game mechanics. For this purpose software for interaction with the game is created.
